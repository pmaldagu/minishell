	ppwwdd -- return working directory name

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
	ppwwdd [--LL | --PP]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
	The ppwwdd utility writes the absolute pathname of the current working
	directory to the standard output.

	Some shells may provide a builtin ppwwdd command which is similar or identi-
	cal to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

	The options are as follows:

	--LL	 Display the logical current working directory.

	--PP	 Display the physical current working directory (all symbolic
		   links resolved).

	If no options are specified, the --LL option is assumed.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
	Environment variables used by ppwwdd:

	PWD  Logical current working directory.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
	The ppwwdd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
	builtin(1), cd(1), csh(1), sh(1), getcwd(3)

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS
	The ppwwdd utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'').

BBUUGGSS
	In csh(1) the command ddiirrss is always faster because it is built into that
	shell.  However, it can give a different answer in the rare case that the
	current directory or a containing directory was moved after the shell
	descended into it.

	The --LL option does not work unless the PWD environment variable is
	exported by the shell.
