	The env utility executes another utility after modifying the environment
	as specified on the command line.  Each name=value option specifies the
	setting of an environment variable, name, with a value of value.  All
	such environment variables are set before the utility is executed.

	The options are as follows:

	--ii	 Execute the utility with only those environment variables speci-
		   fied by name=value options.  The environment inherited by eennvv is
		   ignored completely.

	--PP altpath
		   Search the set of directories as specified by altpath to locate
		   the specified utility program, instead of using the value of the
		   PATH environment variable.

	--SS string
		   Split apart the given string into multiple strings, and process
		   each of the resulting strings as separate arguments to the eennvv
		   utility.  The --SS option recognizes some special character escape
		   sequences and also supports environment-variable substitution, as
		   described below.

	--uu name
		   If the environment variable name is in the environment, then
		   remove it before processing the remaining options.  This is simi-
		   lar to the uunnsseett command in sh(1).  The value for name must not
		   include the `=' character.

	--vv	 Print verbose information for each step of processing done by the
		   eennvv utility.  Additional information will be printed if --vv is
		   specified multiple times.

	The above options are only recognized when they are specified before any
	name=value options.

	If no utility is specified, eennvv prints out the names and values of the
	variables in the environment, with one name/value pair per line.

	The processing of the --SS option will split the given string into separate
	arguments based on any space or <tab> characters found in the string.
	Each of those new arguments will then be treated as if it had been speci-
	fied as a separate argument on the original eennvv command.

	Spaces and tabs may be embedded in one of those new arguments by using
	single (``''') or double (`"') quotes, or backslashes (`\').  Single
	quotes will escape all non-single quote characters, up to the matching
	single quote.  Double quotes will escape all non-double quote characters,
	up to the matching double quote.  It is an error if the end of the string
	is reached before the matching quote character.

	If --SS would create a new argument that starts with the `#' character,
	then that argument and the remainder of the string will be ignored.  The
	`\#' sequence can be used when you want a new argument to start with a
	`#' character, without causing the remainder of the string to be skipped.

	While processing the string value, --SS processing will treat certain char-
	acter combinations as escape sequences which represent some action to
	take.  The character escape sequences are in backslash notation.  The
	characters and their meanings are as follows:

		 \\cc	 Ignore the remaining characters in the string.  This must
			    not appear inside a double-quoted string.
		 \\ff	 Replace with a <form-feed> character.
		 \\nn	 Replace with a <new-line> character.
		 \\rr	 Replace with a <carriage return> character.
		 \\tt	 Replace with a <tab> character.
		 \\vv	 Replace with a <vertical tab> character.
		 \\##	 Replace with a `#' character.  This would be useful when
			    you need a `#' as the first character in one of the argu-
			    ments created by splitting apart the given string.
		 \\$$	 Replace with a `$' character.
		 \\	 If this is found inside of a double-quoted string, then
			    replace it with a single blank.  If this is found outside
			    of a quoted string, then treat this as the separator char-
			    acter between new arguments in the original string.
		 \\""	 Replace with a <double quote> character.
		 \\''	 Replace with a <single quote> character.
		 \\\\	 Replace with a backslash character.

	The sequences for <single-quote> and backslash are the only sequences
	which are recognized inside of a single-quoted string.  The other
	sequences have no special meaning inside a single-quoted string.  All
	escape sequences are recognized inside of a double-quoted string.  It is
	an error if a single `\' character is followed by a character other than
	the ones listed above.

	The processing of --SS also supports substitution of values from environ-
	ment variables.  To do this, the name of the environment variable must be
	inside of `${}', such as: ${SOMEVAR}.  The common shell syntax of
	$SOMEVAR is not supported.  All values substituted will be the values of
	the environment variables as they were when the eennvv utility was origi-
	nally invoked.  Those values will not be checked for any of the escape
	sequences as described above.  And any settings of name=value will not
	effect the values used for substitution in --SS processing.

	Also, --SS processing can not reference the value of the special parameters
	which are defined by most shells.  For instance, --SS can not recognize
	special parameters such as: `$*', `$@', `$#', `$?' or `$$' if they appear
	inside the given string.

	The eennvv utility is often used as the interpreter on the first line of
	interpreted scripts, as described in execve(2).

	Note that the way the kernel parses the `#!' (first line) of an inter-
	preted script has changed as of FreeBSD 6.0.  Prior to that, the FreeBSD
	kernel would split that first line into separate arguments based on any
	whitespace (space or <tab> characters) found in the line.  So, if a
	script named /usr/local/bin/someport had a first line of:

		 #!/usr/local/bin/php -n -q -dsafemode=0

	then the /usr/local/bin/php program would have been started with the
	arguments of:

		 arg[0] = '/usr/local/bin/php'
		 arg[1] = '-n'
		 arg[2] = '-q'
		 arg[3] = '-dsafemode=0'
		 arg[4] = '/usr/local/bin/someport'

	plus any arguments the user specified when executing someport.  However,
	this processing of multiple options on the `#!' line is not the way any
	other operating system parses the first line of an interpreted script.
	So after a change which was made for FreeBSD 6.0 release, that script
	will result in /usr/local/bin/php being started with the arguments of:

		 arg[0] = '/usr/local/bin/php'
		 arg[1] = '-n -q -dsafemode=0'
		 arg[2] = '/usr/local/bin/someport'

	plus any arguments the user specified.  This caused a significant change
	in the behavior of a few scripts.  In the case of above script, to have
	it behave the same way under FreeBSD 6.0 as it did under earlier
	releases, the first line should be changed to:

		 #!/usr/bin/env -S /usr/local/bin/php -n -q -dsafemode=0

	The eennvv utility will be started with the entire line as a single argu-
	ment:

		 arg[1] = '-S /usr/local/bin/php -n -q -dsafemode=0'

	and then --SS processing will split that line into separate arguments
	before executing /usr/local/bin/php.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
	The eennvv utility uses the PATH environment variable to locate the
	requested utility if the name contains no `/' characters, unless the --PP
	option has been specified.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
	The eennvv utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.  An exit
	status of 126 indicates that utility was found, but could not be exe-
	cuted.  An exit status of 127 indicates that utility could not be found.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
	Since the eennvv utility is often used as part of the first line of an
	interpreted script, the following examples show a number of ways that the
	eennvv utility can be useful in scripts.

	The kernel processing of an interpreted script does not allow a script to
	directly reference some other script as its own interpreter.  As a way
	around this, the main difference between

		 #!/usr/local/bin/foo
	and
		 #!/usr/bin/env /usr/local/bin/foo

	is that the latter works even if /usr/local/bin/foo is itself an inter-
	preted script.

	Probably the most common use of eennvv is to find the correct interpreter
	for a script, when the interpreter may be in different directories on
	different systems.  The following example will find the `perl' inter-
	preter by searching through the directories specified by PATH.

		 #!/usr/bin/env perl

	One limitation of that example is that it assumes the user's value for
	PATH is set to a value which will find the interpreter you want to exe-
	cute.  The --PP option can be used to make sure a specific list of directo-
	ries is used in the search for utility.  Note that the --SS option is also
	required for this example to work correctly.

		 #!/usr/bin/env -S -P/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin perl

	The above finds `perl' only if it is in /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin.  That
	could be combined with the present value of PATH, to provide more flexi-
	bility.  Note that spaces are not required between the --SS and --PP options:

		 #!/usr/bin/env -S-P/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:${PATH} perl

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
	The eennvv utility accepts the -- option as a synonym for --ii.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS
	The eennvv utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'').  The --PP,
	--SS, --uu and --vv options are non-standard extensions supported by FreeBSD,
	but which may not be available on other operating systems.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
	The eennvv command appeared in 4.4BSD.  The --PP, --SS and --vv options were added
	in FreeBSD 6.0.

BBUUGGSS
	The eennvv utility does not handle values of utility which have an equals
	sign (`=') in their name, for obvious reasons.

	The eennvv utility does not take multibyte characters into account when pro-
	cessing the --SS option, which may lead to incorrect results in some
	locales.
